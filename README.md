# Human-Machine Co-Ideation via Combinational Generative Model

This repository is the official PyTorch implementation of the paper "Human-Machine Co-Ideation via Combinational Generative Model." 

## Abstract
Ideation is a critical step in the engineering design process, enabling designers to develop creative and innovative concepts and prototypes. Currently, the ideation workflow requires designers to generate new designs based on product requirements, heavily relying on their personal expertise and experience. To advance human-machine collaboration design and assist designers in the idea-generation process, this paper proposes an integrated approach that combines generative adversarial networks (GANs) with data mining techniques. The proposed method includes an image encoder module and a cross-domain object combination generator module. The image encoder module captures and encodes image structure information into latent space, while the cross-domain object combination generator module leverages GANs to combine object images based on user preferences, producing new design images. A design case study is used to evaluate the new ideation approach and reveal not only strong cross-domain concept combination capabilities but also improvement in designers' workflow and provision of novelty to the design case.
